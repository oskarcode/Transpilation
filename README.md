# Transpilation
At this point, you are familiar with ES6+ browser compatibility issues and how to address them with transpilation.

In this project, you will practice setting up a JavaScript directory with Babel to transpile ES6+ code to ES5.

Before you begin, take note of the chart to the right. The first column displays the percentage of web browsers that support the given ES6+ syntax. At the end of this project, we will populate the second column with the equivalent ES5 syntax and the percentage of web browsers that recognize it.

Because this is a short project and knowing the steps to set up Babel is important, we recommend you complete it a couple of times. Also, if youâ€™re stuck and think you may have typed the wrong command, select the reset project button and start from the beginning.
